Some cohorts will have already built the WeatherApp using html/css/js during the Interview Practice day.  If they have already built the WeatherApp then we should highlight why it is a good idea when learning new technologies to build an application that you've already built in another language.  Here is an example of how an instructor can frame that.

"When you learn new languages, technologies and new tools it can be overwhelming to take on the new technology itself as well as solving new and unique problems.  So the best way to learn a new technology is actually to build something you've already solved in a technology you already know.  

As an example, many developers build and rebuild a ToDoList with every front end framework they learn.  Thats because they do not need to solve unique problems, but instead can focus on the new framework.  Here's an [example of a site](http://todomvc.com/) that has exactly that, a ToDoList in every front end framework.
For today's exercise, we are going to try to rebuild the WeatherApp using React.  You already know the styles that need to be applied and the elements you need in html, but will need to figure out how to implement that in React"
